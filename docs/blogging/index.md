# Behind the blog

## Hmm...
- Some thoughts here for me to make really good blogs.
- Could you use the "youtube" model to fine tune the blogs?
> **Hook**: get them in  
> **Stakes**: get them interested  
> **Story** focussed 100% through: keep them engaged  
> **Resolution**: Satisfy so they come back

## Feedback to remember
- 2000+ words is too long.
- People really like the flow, "like an adventure"
- People like the energy
- Headings are much better than blank text
- The stable diff images are pretty good


## Best practices
- Headings
- 5 min read: 1250 words @ 250 wpm
