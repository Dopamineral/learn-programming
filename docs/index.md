Programming stuff here. Pro tip, look next to the ***search bar*** for ***DARK MODE***
The *search bar* actually *works* btw!

### Content

- ***Data Engineering*** *(actually my job bro)*

### Why?

I like to learn and like to share

### What is this?

I'm not too sure what I want to do with this part of the site.
On the one end it might be nice to give like tutorials on how to program,
but on the other hand there's like an avalance of information out there on the internet for free.

## This part is forked from another account
Will this end up on the site succesfully?
