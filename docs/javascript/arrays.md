# Arrays

## Filter

get certain values out of an array with filter.
Filter takes a function thing as inside argument.
```js

const myArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

myArray.filter(element => element > 5)

```


## Spread operator

This is a way to get the values of an array inside a new array

```js

const arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
const arr2 = [...arr1]
cosnt arr3 = [1,2,3,4, ...arr2]

```
